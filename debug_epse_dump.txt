Solid polycarbonate sheet 
Product description and intended use 
Solid polycarbonate sheets are unique engineering thermoplastics 
that combine a high level of mechanical, optical and thermal 
properties, which can be used for a wide range of glazing 
applications. 
Description of the production process and 
technology 
Sheets are formed by extrusion. Polycarbonate powder or pellets 
are heated to a molten state and pushed through a die and over 
calendering rolls of the desired cross section and then transported 
over rollers to cool down in a continuous process.

INFORMATION ON ALLOCATION 
At the manufacturing sites of the EPSE members, different types of 
sheets are produced. In some cases, solid polycarbonate sheets are 
produced only on certain production lines, with no co-products being 
produced as part of the process. In some cases, only facility-level data 
were available for electricity use, the use of natural gas, etc. The facility-
level data have been allocated to the analyzed product using their 
respective annual production volume (physical relationship), therefore 
volume allocation is applied. 
INFORMATION ON CUT OFF 
All major raw materials and all the essential energy is included. 
Packaging of one of the pigments used was not included, as data was 
not available. The amount was very small, negligible, and considered 
under the cut-off threshold. 
REFERENCE SERVICE LIFE 
Average reference service life is of 30 years 
DESCRIPTION OF GEOGRAPHICAL

INFORMATION ON CARBON OFFSETTING 
Carbon 
offsetting 
is 
not 
allowed 
in 
the 
EN 
15804:2012+A2:2019 and hence not considered in the 
calculations. 
INFORMATION ON CARBONATION OF 
CEMENTITIOUS MATERIALS 
Nothing to declare 
INFORMATION ON EXCLUDED PROCESSES 
Environmental impacts caused by the personnel of the 
production plants are not included in the LCA, e.g., waste 
from the cafeteria and sanitary installations, accidental 
pollution caused by human mistakes, or environmental 
effects caused by commuter traffic. Heating or cooling of 
the plants in order to ensure a comfortable indoor climate 
for the personnel is also neglected.

Data 
Specificity 
The life cycle inventory for this study is performed by EPSE and 
ENPERAS/VITO according to the ISO 14040 and ISO 14044 (data 
inventory) standards (ISO, 2006).  
Specific data have been collected for the processes under operational 
control of EPSE companies. Generic data have been used for the 
processes EPSE cannot influence. 
Period of data collection 
Data was collected for the year 2019. The final amounts are based on 
the weighted averages of the 7 data providers. 
Information on data collection 
Company-specific data concern the data about the production of the 
polycarbonate sheets. All required data about the production process 
have been delivered to Enperas/VITO by EPSE. Enperas/VITO uses 
publicly available generic data for all background processes such as 
the production of electricity, transportation by means of a specific 
truck, etc. The main LCI source used in this LCA study is the 
Ecoinvent 3.6 database (June 2019). 
Database used for background data 
The main LCI source used in this study is the Ecoinvent 
3.6 database (Wernet et al., 2016). 
Energy mix 
The European electricity mix (consumption mix + 
import) has been used to model electricity use in life 
cycle stages A3, C4 and D. The used record is the 
Ecoinvent record ‘Electricity, medium voltage {Europe 
without Switzerland} | market group for | Cut-off, U and 
‘Electricity, low voltage {Europe without Switzerland}| 
market group for | Cut-off, U’ 
(Wernet et al., 2016).

Details of the underlying scenarios used to calculate the impacts 
A1 – Raw material supply 
This module considers the extraction and processing of all raw 
materials and energy which occur upstream to the studied 
manufacturing process. 
A2 – Transport to the manufacturer 
The raw materials are transported to the manufacturing site. 
Primary data was collected for each raw material from each 
manufacturer. 
A3 – Manufacturing 
This module considers the production process. 
A4 – Transport to the building site

A5 – Installation 
The scope of the study is established as cradle-to-gate with 
options, where A4 is included but A5 is not. For the installation 
there are multiple build-up alternatives, depending on the 
application. Accounting for all of them is not possible within the 
framework of this study. However, the disposal of waste 
generated from the packaging of the final product is normally 
allocated to the installation phase, A5.  
B – Use stage (excluding potential savings) 
B1, B2, B3, B4, B5, B6: Modules are not declared. Since no 
maintenance, replacement or operational energy use are 
necessary during the Reference Service Life (RSL) of the 
product (30 years), no environmental impacts occur during these 
modules. 
C – End of life 
The polycarbonate solid sheets are 39,0% landfilled, 32,2% 
incinerated and 28,8% recycled. The EU scenarios for the 
transport of waste are: 
The EU scenarios for the transport of waste are: 
• 
50 km with a 16–32-ton EURO 5 lorry from demolition 
site to sorting plant/crusher/collection point and 
landfilling. 
• 
150 km with a 16-32ton EURO 5 lorry from sorting 
plant and incineration/energy recovery. 
• 
800 km with a 16-32ton EURO 5 lorry from sorting 
plant and recycling. 
 
C1: Dismantling 
It is assumed that the dismantling of the PC sheets will only cover 
the un-screwing the PC sheet from whatever build-up it is 
installed. A generic assumption is that around 8 screws are 
necessary for 1 m2 PC sheet and 1.11 screws are needed for the 
FU of 1 kg of solid PC sheet, where an amount of 0,0216 kWh  
per screw is used. The dataset used to model the impacts is 
“Electricity, low voltage {Europe without Switzerland} | market 
group for | Cut-off, U”. 
C2-C4: The polycarbonate solid sheets are 39,0% landfilled, 
32,2% incinerated and 28,8% recycled.

Environmental impact categories explained 
 
 
Global Warming Potential 
The global warming potential of a gas refers to the total contribution to global warming resulting 
from the emission of one unit of that gas relative to one unit of the reference gas, carbon dioxide, 
which is assigned a value of 1. 
 
It is split up in 4: 
 
- 
Global Warming Potential total (GWP-total) which is the sum of GWP-fossil, GWP-biogenic 
and GWP-luluc 
- 
Global Warming Potential fossil fuels (GWP-fossil): The global warming potential related to 
greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions to any media originating from the oxidation and/or reduction 
of fossil fuels by means of their transformation or degradation (e.g. combustion, digestion, 
landfilling, etc). 
- 
Global Warming Potential biogenic (GWP-biogenic) : The global warming potential related to 
carbon emissions to air (CO2, CO and CH4) originating from the oxidation and/or reduction of 
aboveground biomass by means of its transformation or degradation (e.g. combustion, 
digestion, composting, landfilling) and CO2 uptake from the atmosphere through photosynthesis 
during biomass growth – i.e. corresponding to the carbon content of products, biofuels or above 
ground plant residues such as litter and dead wood.1 
- 
Global Warming Potential land use and land use change (GWP-luluc): The global warming 
potential related to carbon uptakes and emissions (CO2, CO and CH4) originating from carbon 
stock changes caused by land use change and land use. This sub-category includes biogenic 
carbon exchanges from deforestation, road construction or other soil activities (including soil 
carbon emissions).   
 
 
Ozone Depletion Potential 
Destruction of the stratospheric ozone layer which shields the earth from ultraviolet radiation 
harmful to life. This destruction of ozone is caused by the breakdown of certain chlorine and/or 
bromine containing compounds (chlorofluorocarbons or halons), Which break down when they 
reach the stratosphere and then catalytically destroy ozone molecules. 
 
Acidification Potential 
 
Acid depositions have negative impacts on natural ecosystems and the man-made environment incl. 
buildings. The main sources for emissions of acidifying substances are agriculture and fossil fuel 
combustion used for electricity production, heating and transport. 
 
Eutrophication Potential 
 
The potential to cause over-fertilization of water and soil, which can result in increased growth of 
biomass and following adverse effects. 
 
It is split up in 3:  
 
- 
Eutrophication Potential – freshwater: The potential to cause over-fertilization of freshwater, 
which can result in increased growth of biomass and following adverse effects. 
- 
Eutrophication Potential – marine: The potential to cause over-fertilization of marine water, 
which can result in increased growth of biomass and following adverse effects. 
- 
Eutrophication Potential – terrestrial: The potential to cause over-fertilization of soil, which 
can result in increased growth of biomass and following adverse effects. 
 
Photochemical ozone 
Creation Potential 
 
Chemical reactions brought about by the light energy of the sun creating photochemical smog. The 
reaction of nitrogen oxides with hydrocarbons in the presence of sunlight to form ozone is an example 
of a photochemical reaction. 
 
Abiotic Depletion Potential  
for non-fossil resources 
Consumption of non-renewable resources, thereby lowering their availability for future generations. 
Expressed in comparison to Antimony (Sb). 
 
The results of this environmental impact indicator shall be used with care as the uncertainties on 
these results are high or as there is limited experienced with the indicator.  
 
 
Abiotic Depletion Potential  
for fossil resources 
Measure for the depletion of fossil fuels such as oil, natural gas, and coal. The stock of the fossil 
fuels is formed by the total amount of fossil fuels, expressed in Megajoules (MJ).  
 
The results of this environmental impact indicator shall be used with care as the uncertainties on 
these results are high or as there is limited experienced with the indicator.  
 
 
1 Carbon exchanges from native forests shall be modelled under GWP - luluc (including connected soil emissions, derived products, or residues), while their CO2 uptake is 
excluded. 

 
 
12
 
Ecotoxicity for aquatic fresh 
water 
The impacts of chemical substances on ecosystems (freshwater). 
 
The results of this environmental impact indicator shall be used with care as the uncertainties on 
these results are high or as there is limited experienced with the indicator.  
 
 
Human toxicity (carcinogenic 
effects) 
 
The impacts of chemical substances on human health via three parts of the environment: air, soil 
and water.  
 
The results of this environmental impact indicator shall be used with care as the uncertainties on 
these results are high or as there is limited experienced with the indicator.  
 
 
Human toxicity (non-
carcinogenic effects) 
 
The results of this environmental impact indicator shall be used with care as the uncertainties on 
these results are high or as there is limited experienced with the indicator.  
 
 
Particulate matter  
Accounts for the adverse health effects on human health caused by emissions of Particulate Matter 
(PM) and its precursors (NOX, SOX, NH3) 
 
Resource depletion (water) 
Accounts for water use related to local scarcity of water as freshwater is a scarce resource in some 
regions, while in others it is not. 
 
The results of this environmental impact indicator shall be used with care as the uncertainties on 
these results are high or as there is limited experienced with the indicator.  
 
 
Ionizing radiation - human 
health effects 
 
This impact category deals mainly with the eventual impact on human health of low dose ionizing 
radiation of the nuclear fuel cycle. It does not consider effects due to possible nuclear accidents, 
occupational exposure nor due to radioactive waste disposal in underground facilities. Potential 
ionizing radiation from the soil, from radon and from some construction materials is also not 
measured by this indicator.  
 
Land use related impacts 
The indicator is the “soil quality index” which is the result of an aggregation of following four 
aspects: 
- 
Biotic production 
- 
Erosion resistance 
- 
Mechanical filtration 
- 
Groundwater  
The aggregation is done based on a JRC model. The four aspects are quantified through the LANCA 
model for land use. 
 
The results of this environmental impact indicator shall be used with care as the uncertainties on 
these results are high or as there is limited experienced with the indicator.
