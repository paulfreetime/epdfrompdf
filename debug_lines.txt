LINE 257: INFORMATION ON ALLOCATION 
LINE 258: At the manufacturing sites of the EPSE members, different types of 
LINE 259: sheets are produced. In some cases, solid polycarbonate sheets are 
LINE 260: produced only on certain production lines, with no co-products being 
LINE 261: produced as part of the process. In some cases, only facility-level data 
LINE 262: were available for electricity use, the use of natural gas, etc. The facility-
LINE 263: level data have been allocated to the analyzed product using their 
LINE 264: respective annual production volume (physical relationship), therefore 
LINE 265: volume allocation is applied. 
LINE 266: INFORMATION ON CUT OFF 
LINE 267: All major raw materials and all the essential energy is included. 
LINE 268: Packaging of one of the pigments used was not included, as data was 
LINE 269: not available. The amount was very small, negligible, and considered 
LINE 270: under the cut-off threshold. 
LINE 271: REFERENCE SERVICE LIFE

LINE 293: Environmental impacts caused by the personnel of the 
LINE 294: production plants are not included in the LCA, e.g., waste 
LINE 295: from the cafeteria and sanitary installations, accidental 
LINE 296: pollution caused by human mistakes, or environmental 
LINE 297: effects caused by commuter traffic. Heating or cooling of 
LINE 298: the plants in order to ensure a comfortable indoor climate 
LINE 299: for the personnel is also neglected.

LINE 304: Data 
LINE 305: Specificity 
LINE 306: The life cycle inventory for this study is performed by EPSE and 
LINE 307: ENPERAS/VITO according to the ISO 14040 and ISO 14044 (data 
LINE 308: inventory) standards (ISO, 2006).  
LINE 309: Specific data have been collected for the processes under operational 
LINE 310: control of EPSE companies. Generic data have been used for the 
LINE 311: processes EPSE cannot influence. 
LINE 312: Period of data collection 
LINE 313: Data was collected for the year 2019. The final amounts are based on 
LINE 314: the weighted averages of the 7 data providers. 
LINE 315: Information on data collection 
LINE 316: Company-specific data concern the data about the production of the 
LINE 317: polycarbonate sheets. All required data about the production process 
LINE 318: have been delivered to Enperas/VITO by EPSE. Enperas/VITO uses 
LINE 319: publicly available generic data for all background processes such as 
LINE 320: the production of electricity, transportation by means of a specific 
LINE 321: truck, etc. The main LCI source used in this LCA study is the 
LINE 322: Ecoinvent 3.6 database (June 2019). 
LINE 323: Database used for background data 
LINE 324: The main LCI source used in this study is the Ecoinvent 
LINE 325: 3.6 database (Wernet et al., 2016). 
LINE 326: Energy mix 
LINE 327: The European electricity mix (consumption mix + 
LINE 328: import) has been used to model electricity use in life 
LINE 329: cycle stages A3, C4 and D. The used record is the 
LINE 330: Ecoinvent record ‘Electricity, medium voltage {Europe 
LINE 331: without Switzerland} | market group for | Cut-off, U and 
LINE 332: ‘Electricity, low voltage {Europe without Switzerland}|

LINE 341: This module considers the extraction and processing of all raw 
LINE 342: materials and energy which occur upstream to the studied 
LINE 343: manufacturing process. 
LINE 344: A2 – Transport to the manufacturer 
LINE 345: The raw materials are transported to the manufacturing site. 
LINE 346: Primary data was collected for each raw material from each 
LINE 347: manufacturer.

LINE 378: A5 – Installation 
LINE 379: The scope of the study is established as cradle-to-gate with 
LINE 380: options, where A4 is included but A5 is not. For the installation 
LINE 381: there are multiple build-up alternatives, depending on the 
LINE 382: application. Accounting for all of them is not possible within the 
LINE 383: framework of this study. However, the disposal of waste 
LINE 384: generated from the packaging of the final product is normally 
LINE 385: allocated to the installation phase, A5.  
LINE 386: B – Use stage (excluding potential savings) 
LINE 387: B1, B2, B3, B4, B5, B6: Modules are not declared. Since no 
LINE 388: maintenance, replacement or operational energy use are 
LINE 389: necessary during the Reference Service Life (RSL) of the 
LINE 390: product (30 years), no environmental impacts occur during these 
LINE 391: modules. 
LINE 392: C – End of life 
LINE 393: The polycarbonate solid sheets are 39,0% landfilled, 32,2% 
LINE 394: incinerated and 28,8% recycled. The EU scenarios for the 
LINE 395: transport of waste are: 
LINE 396: The EU scenarios for the transport of waste are:

LINE 408: C1: Dismantling 
LINE 409: It is assumed that the dismantling of the PC sheets will only cover 
LINE 410: the un-screwing the PC sheet from whatever build-up it is 
LINE 411: installed. A generic assumption is that around 8 screws are 
LINE 412: necessary for 1 m2 PC sheet and 1.11 screws are needed for the 
LINE 413: FU of 1 kg of solid PC sheet, where an amount of 0,0216 kWh  
LINE 414: per screw is used. The dataset used to model the impacts is 
LINE 415: “Electricity, low voltage {Europe without Switzerland} | market 
LINE 416: group for | Cut-off, U”.
